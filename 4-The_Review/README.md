# The Review

### HTML & CSS Recapitulation

We've covered a ton of stuff. From how the web works, to writing some html then to making it look awesome with CSS. In this course we will just go back over all that stuff to make sure we have an understanding of all this new stuff.

If you haven't done so by now, you should go back and read through the first 3 lessons.
