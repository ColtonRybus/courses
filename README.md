## Welcome Friends
Hipster Hackers is a group where beginners come to learn. This github repo will be used to store all of our courses here for free. If you can't make a class, don't worry, this material will be here for you to catch up.

If you're an experienced developer, and see some material that could use some improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request. We'd love to hear your feed back.
