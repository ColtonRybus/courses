# Git -r Done

### Turning weekend coders into starter devs

At this point we've done HTML & CSS, but those really aren't programming languages. They are necessary to know in the web business, however. Now that you have your website skills built. How are you saving your work? What would happen if your laptop died right now? Or if someone stole your computer. Would that website you've been working on for the past month be fine? We will be talking about [git](http://git-scm.com/) and all it's many wonderful uses, and why it's important to know.

## Lecture

**The Matrix**

Before we get started talking about git, we need to talk about another tool. We've all seen the movies, and remember the green alphanumeric codes flying across the screen, right?

The tool they're sort of emulating in this scene is not called "the matrix". It's called "the terminal". If you're on a desktop or laptop computer, then your computer already has this tool installed. Most non-programmers have probably heard of "DOS". [DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) was a program that was popular back in the 80's & 90's. That black screen with the white text where you typed in a few commands to load up a game from a floppy disk, or something like that. Well, this program was developed for IBM computers based off an even older system from linux and unix.

This is an image of the Windows Command Prompt. On a Mac/Linux machine we have a similar program called the Terminal. The Terminal is where we can access a command line prompt just like you can with the Windows DOS command prompt. There is quite a big difference between what DOS allowed us to do, and what we have available to us in command line for a Mac/Linux/Unix (*nix) system. Even though they are different, there are still quite a big of similarities. Being a programmer, you'll spend 99.9999% of the time working with a *nix system command line. Even if you decide to be a Windows based developer, you'll still use tools more related to a *nix system unless it's with [Power Shell](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/).

In this lesson, we will only focus on the *nix based commands. So, let's get started!

**Command Line**

To get started, if you're on Windows, you'll need to download the [Git Bash](https://msysgit.github.io/) program. If you're on a Mac, congratulations, you have terminal installed already. Just click on your spotlight magnifying glass and type in "terminal". :bulb: *ProTip*: Save a link to your command line program for easy accessability.
